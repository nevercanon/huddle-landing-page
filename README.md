## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

I will provide screenshots in my GitHub repository.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This is actually the second time I attempted this challenge. The first time, I got so frustrated that I just gave up. It's been a couple of weeks, and I came back to it. I decided I was going to use Grid for the desktop layout. I usually have trouble with Grid, and then give up and use Flexbox, but this time I was determined. I watched a new Grid course on YouTube to refresh my knowledge and learn new things, and then tried this. At first it was frustrating, but then I got it to work! I had to fiddle around with it and try a few different things, but I got there in the end.

I feel like this is the first project in a while where I finished it and felt good about it. I had a bit of difficulty with getting the social media icons centered in their circles, and with figuring out the Grid, but I feel like everything else came together really well. I know it isn't perfect, but I'm really proud of this project.

### Continued development

I'm going to continue working on bigger layouts with Grid and using positioning. That seems to be my biggest weakness so far. I also want to work on CSS animations to make my projects look nicer, which is something I've been avoiding for a while. I hope to complete all the Newbie level challenges on frontendmentor.io, and then move on to the Junior level.

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6CBKf8K_Ac&list=WL&index=51) - This is the new Grid course I watched. It helped me see Grid in a new way and let me be successful working on this project's larger layout.
- [Resource 2](https://fontawesome.com/v6/docs/web/setup/get-started) - This is where I got the social media icons.
